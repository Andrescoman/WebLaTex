abstract = {The prevalence of mental fatigue is a noteworthy phenomenon that can affect individuals across diverse professions and working routines. This paper provides a comprehensive dataset of physiological signals obtained from 23 participants during their professional work and questionnaires to analyze mental fatigue. The questionnaires included demographic information and Chalder Fatigue Scale scores indicating mental and physical fatigue. Both physiological signal measurements and the Chalder Fatigue Scale were performed in two sessions, morning and evening. The present dataset encompasses diverse physiological signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), blood volume pulse (BVP), electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (TEMP), and 3-axis accelerometer (ACC) data. The NeuroSky MindWave EEG device was used for brain signals, and the Empatica E4 smart wristband was used for other signals. Measurements were carried out on individuals from four different occupational groups, such as academicians, technicians, computer engineers, and kitchen workers. The provision of comprehensive metadata supplements the dataset, thereby promoting inquiries about the neurophysiological concomitants of mental fatigue, autonomic activity patterns, and the repercussions of a cognitive burden on human proficiency in actual workplace settings. The accessibility of the aforementioned dataset serves to facilitate progress in the field of mental fatigue research while also laying the groundwork for the creation of customized fatigue evaluation techniques and interventions in diverse professional domains.}

abstract = {When the workers of electric power industry are going to perform high-risk or dispatching operations, it is important to assess the emotional state of the workers. Emotion recognition is helpful to justify whether the works are suitable to grasp and handle the operation status of the power system in time. In this paper, we develop a simple and efficient automatic emotion recognition method based on deep learning theory using ECG signals. Firstly, since Z-score method which is quite popular for emotion recognition exists high missed outlier detection rate, we define a basic beat and removed the abnormal beats according to the similarities between the truncated beats and the basic beat. Secondly, in order to make it easily for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the periodicity features of one-dimensional signal in time domain, we present stacking operation of the truncated segments to increase the dimension of ECG data from one to three. Finally, aiming at decreasing the computation burden, a one-dimensional CNN only consisted of two convolution blocks is designed. The results of applying the proposed approach to the benchmark Wearable Stress and Affect Data set (WESAD) demonstrate that our proposal is capable of classifying four different kinds of emotions with an averaged accuracy of 98.57% and F1 value of 98.73%, respectively. Compared against some literature, the performance of our proposal is superior to them.}

ABSTRACT = {The development of detection methodologies for reliable drowsiness tracking is a challenging task requiring both appropriate signal inputs and accurate and robust algorithms of analysis. The aim of this research is to develop an advanced method to detect the drowsiness stage in electroencephalogram (EEG), the most reliable physiological measurement, using the promising Machine Learning methodologies. The methods used in this paper are based on Machine Learning methodologies such as stacked autoencoder with softmax layers. Results obtained from 62 volunteers indicate 100% accuracy in drowsy/wakeful discrimination, proving that this approach can be very promising for use in the next generation of medical devices. This methodology can be extended to other uses in everyday life in which the maintaining of the level of vigilance is critical. Future works aim to perform extended validation of the proposed pipeline with a wide-range training set in which we integrate the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal and visual information with EEG analysis in order to improve the robustness of the overall approach.},

title = "The Effects of Information and Communication Technology Use on Human Energy and Fatigue: A Review",
abstract = "Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are generally assumed to save time and energy, yet user fatigue due to ICT use is on the rise. The question about the effects of ICT use on human energy and fatigue is marred by inconsistencies in terminology, definitions, and measures. The aim of this paper is therefore twofold. First, we provide a consolidation and classification of subjective energy and fatigue concepts from four leading research areas. Second, we review the empirical literature on the relationship between ICT use and seven different subjective energy and fatigue concepts from the four areas. We show that ICT use can both energize and fatigue users, sometimes even at the same time, a phenomenon that we term Digital Fatigue Paradox. Overall, there is more evidence for the fatiguing effect, which also appear to be stronger, even though ICT users might actually believe the opposite to be true. By consolidating the mechanisms through which ICT use energizes and fatigues users in a conceptual model, we provide initial explanation for the paradox and derive implications for organizational policy, ICT design, and regulation that strive to improve the user experience with ICTs and prevent ill-being, i.e., foster well-being.",

title = "Towards real-time automatic stress detection for office workplaces",
abstract = "In recent years, several stress detection methods have been proposed, usually based on machine learning techniques relying on obstructive sensors, which could be uncomfortable or not suitable in many daily situations. Although studies on emotions are emerging and rising in Software Engineering (SE) research, stress has not been yet well investigated in the SE literature despite its negative impact on user satisfaction and stakeholder performance. In this paper, we investigate whether we can reliably implement a stress detector in a single pipeline suitable for real-time processing following an arousal-based statistical approach. It works with physiological data gathered by the E4-wristband, which registers electrodermal activity (EDA). We have conducted an experiment to analyze the output of our stress detector with regard to the self-reported stress in similar conditions to a quiet office workplace environment when users are exposed to different emotional triggers.",

title = "300 Faces In-The-Wild Challenge: Database and results",
abstract = "Computer Vision has recently witnessed great research advance towards automatic facial points detection. Numerous methodologies have been proposed during the last few years that achieve accurate and efficient performance. However, fair comparison between these methodologies is infeasible mainly due to two issues. (a) Most existing databases, captured under both constrained and unconstrained (in-the-wild) conditions have been annotated using different mark-ups and, in most cases, the accuracy of the annotations is low. (b) Most published works report experimental results using different training/testing sets, different error metrics and, of course, landmark points with semantically different locations. In this paper, we aim to overcome the aforementioned problems by (a) proposing a semi-automatic annotation technique that was employed to re-annotate most existing facial databases under a unified protocol, and (b) presenting the 300 Faces In-The-Wild Challenge (300-W), the first facial landmark localization challenge that was organized twice, in 2013 and 2015. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort towards a unified annotation scheme of massive databases and a fair experimental comparison of existing facial landmark localization systems. The images and annotations of the new testing database that was used in the 300-W challenge are available from http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/300-W_IMAVIS/.",

It is also one of the key factors that strongly affect patients’ health-related quality of life. To date, most fatigue assessment methods were based on self-reporting, which may suffer from many factors such as recall bias. To address this issue, in this work, we recorded multi-modal physiological data (including ECG, accelerometer, skin temperature and respiratory rate, as well as demographic information such as age, BMI) in free-living environments, and developed automated fatigue assessment models. Specifically, we extracted features from each modality, and employed the random forest-based mixed-effects models, which can take advantage of the demographic information for improved performance. We conducted experiments on our collected dataset, and very promising preliminary results were achieved. Our results suggested ECG played an important role in the fatigue assessment tasks.},

abstract="Stress is a complex issue with wide ranging physical and psychological impacts on human daily performance. Specifically, acute stress detection is becoming a valuable application in contextual human understanding. Two common approaches to training a stress detection model are subject-dependent and subject-independent training method. Although subject-dependent training method is proven to be the most accurate approach to build stress detection models, subject-independent one is a more practical and cost-efficient method, as it facilitates the deployment of stress level detection and management systems in consumer-grade wearable devices without requiring additional data for training from end-users. To improve the performance of subject-independent stress detection models, in this paper, we introduce a stress-related bio-signal processing pipeline with a simple neural network architecture using statistical features extracted from multimodal contextual sensing sources including Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), and Skin Temperature (ST) captured from a consumer-grade wearable device. Using our proposed model architecture, we compare the accuracy of stress detection models that use measures from each individual signal source with the one employing the fusion of multiple sensor sources. Extensive experiments on the publicly available WESAD dataset demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms conventional methods as well as providing {\$}{\$}1.63{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}1.63{\%}higher mean accuracy score compared to the state-of-the-art model while maintaining a low standard deviation. Our experiments also show that combining features from multiple sources produces more accurate predictions than using only one sensor source individually.",
